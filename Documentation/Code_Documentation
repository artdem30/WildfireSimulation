Documentation for Simulation

Specific function documentation can be found in the comments in each file. This is an outline of how different
files and classes interact.

Edge Class:
An Edge object is a representation of a probability vector from node object to another. It sets its probability value
based on inputted parameters and the state of the two nodes is connects to.

Node Class:
The Node object represents an fire prone object like a house or tree. Node objects have a list of edge objects that are
generated specifically for that Node. A node has fire states, property value, coordinate, and other characteristics.

Neighborhood Class:
The Neighborhood class sets edges and nodes to form a neighborhood based on the specified parameters and node
coordinates. It also simulates fire spread and handles data.

Simulation Class:
Simulation simply runs the fire spread in a Neighborhood object, a specified amount of trials. Then combines data to
generate statistics.

FileWrite:
Contains functions to write statistics to csv files as well as producing heatmaps.

main:
Combines all classes and files to run a certain type fo simulation style.
